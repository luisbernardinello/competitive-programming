## What is this ?


"it’s a mind sport. It more fully develops your algorithmic reasoning skills and bridges the gap between theory and application in bite-sized chunks. Full participation develops problem solving intuition and competence" - Steven Halim in his book **Competitive Programming 4.**

_In this repository you will see Rust and a little of GoLang_



## :crab: Why Rust? :crab:

Why not ? is readable, maintainable, and crash-free. Rust is awesome.
