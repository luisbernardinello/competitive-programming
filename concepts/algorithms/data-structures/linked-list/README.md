# Linked List

It is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements known as nodes. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains a data field and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.


- In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence.

## Complexity

-   Insert: `O(n)`
-   Delete: `O(n)`
-   Access: `O(n)`
-   Search: `O(n)`
